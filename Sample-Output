Question: What are the main topics in this data?
Failed to send telemetry event CollectionQueryEvent: capture() takes 1
positional argument but 3 were given
Answer:  The main topics in this data include Smart Communication
Modules (Smart Comm Module - Direct) usage, Account information
(Account Number, City, State, Country), Customer Class details
(Residential unit), and timestamps for creation, status update, and
types of usages. Additionally, there are identifiers such as USAGE_ID,
US_ID, MDM_SP_ID, AREA_CD, OFFICE_CD, and DEPARTMENT_CD that provide
structure to the data. However, it should be noted that some fields
like SERVICE_PROVIDER are empty, which may imply that this information
is not relevant for these specific records or that it's left for
future updates.

Question: Can you summarize the key information?
Answer: 1. The office and department are located in Central,
specifically at QASIM ELECTRICITY-AN NABHANIYAH SERVICE CENTER, which
is part of the QASSIM department.
2. There are multiple instances (three) of a smart meter with Device
Type Code SMD and Manufacturer CD ZIV-ALFANAR. The specific device ID
for all these meters is 1000000000000, and their serial numbers start
with AES2020.
3. The billing cycle starts on November 4th, 2025, and lasts for an
unspecified duration (indicated by CD 9).
4. The head-end system for these meters is Schneider HES (SCHN).

Question: Can you tell me how many Residential and Commercial
customers are there?
Answer:  I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided data only shows
information about residential customers. There is no information about
commercial customers in this dataset.

Question: What patterns do you see in the data?
Answer: 1. The same usage ID (25700000000000) is associated with three
different rows of data, each row representing a separate usage event
for a specific account (30019975115).

2. Each row also contains consistent information about the service
type (SMDD - Smart Enabled Digital - Direct), service provider,
customer class (Residential unit), and country (SA - South Africa).
However, the city, state, MDM_SP_ID, area code, and office code are
not provided for all rows.

3. The usage status is consistently set to "Acknowledgement Received"
(ACKRECEIVED) and the status update date time changes with each row,
indicating that the status was updated at different times for each
usage event.

4. Creation date time is consistent across all rows, suggesting these
records were created on the same day and time (2025-01-04 17:13:00).
